###Abstract
* Within the 21st century, technology has evolved exponentially and has become an integral part of college students’ lives. Two developers aimed to target an audience within the Department of Computer & Information Science & Engineering at University of Florida in hopes of increasing productivity. All users that use the internet are susceptible to an overwhelming amount of distraction and multitasking, and those that must spend the majority of time on the computer unfortunately are computer science engineers. At any moment these students have all web tools and social media at their fingertips. The current problem with this is that although students use social media and online tools, there is no way to centralize all of them. The two developers, Kathleen Lew and Jeff Dombroski, created a web application that centralizes the most popular used social media and web tools for CISE students. Before initially starting, the developers surveyed the audience on what types of tools college students used and analyzed why they were popular. Not surprisingly, they learned that the most widely used social media was Facebook. After, they researched if there was a strong correlation with heavy use of social media and grades. They found that there was no significant correlation with long term use of social media and low grades, but the one thing they could confirm was the loss of time. This reaffirmed the developers’ initial intention of creating an application that didn’t replace the tools, but enabled the user to focus more on his or her school work.

###Problem Domain
* All students use online web tools and social media for their own purpose of productivity and enjoyment, but there is no effective web application that centralizes all popular tools used by the CISE department. In their survey, the two developers also found that users treated every tab as a separate entity. In other words, there was no organization between school work tabs versus social media & online tool tabs. Students simply just hit the keys “Ctrl + T” in a repetitive robotic motion and manually clicked through all the tabs again if he or she wanted to revisit that same page. The developers’ tool aimed first at minimizing the amount of tabs a student would have open. This inherently solved the organization problem as well because a student would not have to manually think of what tabs to open to check all of his or her new notifications. This tool would not only achieve consolidation and organization, but it would also harness productivity and leisure into one central location. This way a user could quickly check all notifications at once instead of doing extra effort to make multiple tabs and check each one individually.

###Solution

####Target a specific audience
Due to the environment that Lew and Dombroski grew up in, they both decided to dedicate their time building a project for an audience they have lived with. Those that know their audience best are those that are internal to the system. Hence, the developers targeted the CISE college students.
####Understand what daily online tools and social media the audience uses
After a survey, the developers compiled a list of the most frequent responses of the most popular online tools and social media used for daily purposes. 
####Acknowledge existing tools
It would be ignorant to disregard the current solutions society has presented users. It is common for brilliant inventions to build off of previous ideas. Lew and Dombroski looked at the implementations of a smartphone and used the idea to their advantage. One of the greatest features of the phone is push notifications from multiple applications that load in a single space.
####Proposing an efficient navigation system
One of the most important considerations developers had to take in was how a user would navigate throughout the web app. So they asked random samples of the population what was the most important thing to a user when he or she was skimming through information. Because information is aligned from top to bottom, the majority stated that maximizing screenspace was important. This also parallels to how most developers, when viewing code, find it necessary to all screen space from top to bottom. Therefore the navigation bar was placed on the left hand side instead of the top so it did not interfere with screen space.

The ordering of icons within the navigational bar was important because it would establish priority. Because time was the most preeminent factor that correlated to productivity, google calendar was placed first. Gmail was reported to have more professional communication.
####Comparing and Contrasting Navigational Systems
Upon first impression developers conducted a small study using FIgure A asking users if they could immediately identify which tab was related to school work. It took students an average of 5.2 seconds to read all of the titles of the tabs and identify the correct tab.
Furthermore, the average CISE Student is used to having more than 20 tabs open at one time. This would then condense the amount of visible text allowed on the screen. From Figure A, the amount of tabs took up the entire width of the screen. Simply reducing 5 tabs into 1 would allow for more screen space for a user. 
The web application also allows a clear separation of work and play. All of the social media & online tools are consolidated in 1 location promoting a distraction free workspace.
####Data Display Content
With this tool, the developers had to decide what was the most important data to display for each online tool in the web application. Gmail and Facebook was the more difficult decision. Lew and Dombroski mimicked the display of Gmail messages and limited it to the sender and small snippet of the message. Originally the developers were going to limit the Facebook display to only notifications, but after surveying students, most students used Facebook to message others for group projects. Therefore, they decided to include most recent and unread messages within the Facebook display.

####Implementation
The two developers configured this web application to the Facebook API, Gmail API, Google Calendar API and made a RSS feed for Yahoo Weather and Fandango recent movies. They used localhost to test their sites and embedded the php configuration files within each site every time a user wanted to start a session. Google and Facebook have cached the user’s login information.

####Conclusions
The main work of the project came from connecting and organizing the data related to the different APIs that would be the backbone of our application. The APIs we connected to included Facebook, Google Mail, Google Calendar, Yahoo Weather, and Fandango. After connecting to each of these APIs, the two developers displayed the data in a clear, simplified fashion to minimize the time it takes for the user to get information from any of the different resources and allow them to check these things for a maximum increase in productivity. Once they had connected to and implemented the different APIs, they created clear, simple styling to the page to make it feel more modern.
From this project Lew and Dombroski learned the difficulties of connecting to various APIs and getting the them to work cohesively within one web application. They found that sessions between different tools cannot be active on the same page. The documentation for many of the APIs was still in beta, providing limited support. The APIs themselves would at times have errors that needed to be fixed within them. While different resources are hard to bring together, once they are functioning Lew and Dombroski found that the aggregated application provides an efficient and easy to use method of using the most important functionality of these different resources.
The only open problem currently existing would be the way sessions are handled by the APIs, such that more than one API can not be accessed on the same page at any given time.
The main advantage of the work is time preservation. By using this application users save time that would be wasted endlessly scrolling through social updates and other unimportant information that limits productivity. Thus, users are more efficient with schoolwork and other important tasks while using our application.
Some of the disadvantages of using the application include not having the ability to respond to Facebook messages or mail from the site itself. In order to respond, users currently have to navigate to the main sites for those applications. The other main disadvantage is that users cannot directly manipulate events on the Google Calendar. They can only add events, as editing an event would require them to navigate directly to the Google Calendar site. Smaller disadvantages include weather only supporting a day by day forecast and movies not providing more than the title of the movies.
Future directions this project could be taken would include expanding upon the resources available. While they limited the scope of the project to Google Mail, Facebook, Google Calendar, Yahoo Weather, and Fandango,  there are other online tools such as Twitter, Yahoo Mail, AOL, etc. that can be implemented. Lew and Dombroski have also implemented restrictions so that the user is limited to view-only on Facebook chat and Google mail. Something that could be done in the future is allowing the user to respond if they choose from our application. Our application could also be expanded to support real-time updates.

		Angelos provided the DAS students with great input on how to structure things more efficiently using an object-oriented design for messages from different systems, which helped them simplify the project as it was becoming more complex and harder to manage the different components. He also provided them with suggestions on configuration and organization of the data on the screen that helped provide a cleaner and more efficient layout to our application.
	Stackoverflow
		Whenever there were issues with configuring an API, Stackoverflow often had good resources from users that would help us debug problems. This was especially helpful as the API documentation was often lacking for these different tools.
